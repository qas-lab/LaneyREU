This project is structured in term different versions. Each of the versions begins with a cell of all the librarys you need to import for that version to run.
All versions can be run independently
Here are the versions described below:
Laney REU 2024: Used a summary of 20ish bug reports from gpt and compared cosine similarities within topics
Laney_REU_2024_draft2.:Failed attempt to use the GPT API to summerize bug reports and compared cosine similarities within topics
Laney_REU_2024_draft3_no_summaries:Stopped using summeraizing and refactored code so that it would compared cosine similarities within topics
Laney_REU_2024_draft5_timesorted: Seperated the dataframe into different time frames rather than topics and compared cosine similarities 
Laney_REU_2024_draft6_similarity_val_change1: tested different thershold values for cosine similarity to classify them as duplicate or not duplicate 
Laney_REU_2024_draft8_top_k: created a function to output k number of similar bugs rather than bugs above a certain similarity thershold 
Laney_REU_2024_draft9: performed recall and precsison on the top k similar bugs
